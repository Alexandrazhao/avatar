# Sketch 4:  Avatar

**Create your own game avatar with p5.js.**

## Rules

1. Begin your sketch with a comment including your name, email, date, collaboration statement, and reflection.
2. Use at least two different shape primitives (e.g. point, line, rect, quad, triangle, ellipse).
3. Use at least two shades of gray and two other non-gray colors.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the Processing coordinate system.
- Use Processing shapes.
- Understand color spaces.
- Create a static image with code.
- Visualize yourself.

When you are finished, reflect in a comment at the top of your sketch about what you were trying to accomplish. How does the graphical form of running the program compare with the textual nature of the code?
